# final_project Group 1. NBA Player Replacement


Web deployment:    https://share.streamlit.io/aburstyn9068/nba_player_comparison/main/app.py

This app can be used to determine who will be a suitable replacement for a player on your NBA Team roster. Using the input variables on the sidebar to the left, you can select the player you want to replace. The players can be filtered by team and position. Additionally, you can select a maximum salary for replacement player options.

After a player is selected, the top 5 closest players to target player will be displayed. 

The network graph seen below shows the relationship between the players. Distance between them and target player, salaries, etc

The players stats can be compared using the interactive bar graph below. Stats and players can be added or removed from the graph by clicking on them.
